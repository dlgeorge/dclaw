# Examples

There are two examples to illustrate the capabilites of D-Claw: gully and radial slide. 

## Gully 

The gully example is located within `dclaw/examples/gully` and is an idealized example of a debris flow moving down a confined channel and then out onto an unconfined plane. To run this example, first [install D-Claw](#install-dclaw) and then navigate to the gully application directory and execute: 

```bash 
make .exe
make input
make .plots
```

## Radial Slide

The radial slide example is located within `dclaw/examples/radial_slide` and is an ideallized example of a landslide-tsunami from a radially symmetric island. To run this example, first [install D-Claw](#install-dclaw) and then navigate to the radial slide application directory and execute: 

```bash 
make .exe
make input
make .plots
```
